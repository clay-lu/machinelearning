# Prospective Analyst

#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, R, VBA, AWS, Tableau, EXCEL

## Education
- Johns Hopkins Carey Business School (_July 2024_) \
  M.S., Business Analytics and Risk Management         		
- Lehigh University (_May 2019_) \
  B.S., Economics & Business Information System

## Work Experience
**Supply Chain Analyst Intern @ \
The Chemours Company (_January 2023 - May 2023_)**
- I enhanced logistics functions by improving cylinder return rates and generating critical reports. I upgraded the Bowersox Safety Stock Calculator using demand forecasting techniques, developed a SharePoint site for process control, and automated workflows using Alteryx and Power BI. My leadership in regional workshop preparation and data management, alongside creating impactful visualizations in Tableau, bolstered decision-making in cylinder management projects.

**Investment Research Analyst Intern @ \
AIDVP (_June 2022 - August 2022_)**
- I produced bi-weekly thematic investment publications, guided by macroeconomic events. I collaborated with peers for market insights and spearheaded a team of interns to research capital market strategies. My analytical skills were demonstrated by generating a CDS-basis monitor to gauge trading sentiment and by creating a dashboard highlighting prevalent research ideas, fostering a knowledge-sharing environment within the cohort.

## Projects
### Enhanced Prediction of Body Fat Percentage
[WOW Project](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/clay-lu/3b3b8e36a4bdc36eb86d0d61e57eb3ae/wow-project-notebook.ipynb)

This project aims to predict body fat percentage using various regression techniques including Multiple Linear Regression, LASSO Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, and other machine learning algorithms. The dataset comprises physical measurements and body composition metrics. After extensive data preprocessing and model evaluation, the Random Forest Regressor demonstrated the best performance with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.488 and an R-squared value of 0.7655. These findings suggest that ensemble methods are effective in predicting body fat percentage, offering valuable insights for health and fitness assessments.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://xxx)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
