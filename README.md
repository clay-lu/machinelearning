## Projects
### Enhanced Prediction of Body Fat Percentage
[WOW Project](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/clay-lu/3b3b8e36a4bdc36eb86d0d61e57eb3ae/wow-project-notebook.ipynb)

This project aims to predict body fat percentage using various regression techniques including Multiple Linear Regression, LASSO Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, and other machine learning algorithms. The dataset comprises physical measurements and body composition metrics. After extensive data preprocessing and model evaluation, the Random Forest Regressor demonstrated the best performance with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.488 and an R-squared value of 0.7655. These findings suggest that ensemble methods are effective in predicting body fat percentage, offering valuable insights for health and fitness assessments.
